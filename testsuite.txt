Because of the nature of BOLD, unit tests are quite limited in their
ability to determine if the application functions as intended. In order to make
it less likely that broken code goes undetected, I have opted to create this
file that contains a "manual teste suite". The entire suite of tests need not
be run each time code is committed, although it should be conducted
when tagging snapshots as "stable".

1. Ensure the navigation of activities is congruent with the design graph.
I have drawn up a graph with nodes as activities and edges as the transition
between them. (I'll eventually scan it but that's not desperate as I'll likely
be the only one doing the testing for some time).

The application should be navigated through, checking each node and edge is in
line with what's on the handwritten graph to make sure things such as the
activity lifecycle methods function as expected. This first test should be
conducted simultaneously with the following tests and last the timespan of the
testing. This is so that the application is tested in the context of the
program state changing as it when all the application's functionality is used.
(For instance, we want to ensure that the user list is actually updated when a
new user is created and then returns to the UserSelectionActivity).

Remember that one can always hit the offscreen back button (although the app is
intended to make this unnecessary ) and the expected functionality of that
should be considered in the graph. The users can also hit the home button so we
need to deal with these cases at some point too.
