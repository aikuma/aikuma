Installation
------------

There are two approaches to installing Aikuma. The simplest is to install it
on an android phone via Google Play
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lp20.aikuma).

The second approach involves building Aikuma. In order to build Aikuma the
Android SDK is required. For information on how to set up the Android SDK,
visit http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html.

With the Android SDK set up and an Android phone connected to the computer,
run:

$ Aikuma/build.sh
