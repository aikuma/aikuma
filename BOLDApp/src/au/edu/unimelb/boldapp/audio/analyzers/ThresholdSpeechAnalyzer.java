/** Analyzes the samples given to it.

 *  It also remembers what it had heard before.
 *  
 *  Silence: After speech, it listens a bit longer
 *           and if no speech is forthcoming, it will
 *           switch to silence mode, waiting for speech.
 *           It does not instantly call silenceTriggered
 *           Because the speaker might just have a quick
 *           pause in between words.
 *           (Recommended is 2 seconds of consecutive
 *           silence data)
 *
 *  Speech: After silence, it listens to whether speech
 *          is occurring. If it does it will not instantly
 *          call back the audioTriggered method.
 *          Instead it waits if it wasn't just a noise, but
 *          listens for further audio to occur.
 *          (Recommended is 0.08 seconds of consecutive
 *          speech data)

 * A diagram of how this Analyzer works:
 *               _----_/\_-_
 *             _/           \_
 * ___________/               \____/\________________
 *   |<- pre ->|<-  speech  ->|<- after ->|<- silence
 *
 * 1. The Analyzer remembers PREAMBLE_BUFFERS buffers to
 *    remember before speech.
 * 2. As soon as speech occurs (speechTriggerAmount speech buffers
 *    have occurred), it saves EMPTY_SPEECH_PREAMBLE_BUFFERS buffers
 *    followed by the PREAMBLE_BUFFERS buffers.
 * 3. Then it continues to recognize speech until silenceTriggerAmount
 *    buffers have been recognized as silence.
 * 4. It then saves AFTER_SPEECH_BUFFERS buffers and starts recognizing
 *    silence, until 1. occurs again.
