Aikuma Mobile App Development Plan
------------------------------------------

* Action bar (including menu) [more or less done] (took 1 day)
* Record activity: 1 day
* Settings (default language) 1 day
* Metadata activity (language selection and add speaker and select speaker and
		 speaker item). 3 days
* Metadata confirmation (Ghetto) < 1 day
* Recording list item 2 days
* Player/playing fragment 1 day 
* Respeaker. 2 days
* Player switching (to some capacity) / commentaries fragment. 3 days
* Automatic syncing. 3 days
* Settings (IP address) 1 day
* Player cleanup 3 days

As it stands, the above will take 21 days. I'll multiply it by a magic factor
of 1.5 as there will be various necessary tasks that will pop up (which I'll add
to the list) that aren't directly related to any given task (things to do with
ensuring code quality and such). So 32 days of work all up. If I work on it 3
days a week, 1.0.0 will be complete late August. My estimates may be way
off though (they usually are).

* Sync "number" (All filenames that aren't in progress, all filenames in a sorted array, hash of that array)
* Tabs (sorting/filtering, see design)
* Audio monitor
* Metadata confirmation (nice)
* Speaker
* New Search screen
* Search Engine
* Search Results screen

After that / Future:

  - 3G connection to a central server.
  - Spoken language help.
  - Multiple languages.
  - Elan adapter for importing into Elan.
