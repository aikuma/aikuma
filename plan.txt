Tentative BOLD Mobile App Development Plan
------------------------------------------

To be frank: As with all plans, they are subject to change / not set in stone.
This document expresses a wish where we (ie. I, Florian ;)) would like to be at some point in time.

It denotes goals on a weekly basis.
They are intentionally short/concise.

August:
  - Recording
  - Respeaking / Translating
  - File Structure (for Listening)
  - Listening (Filters: per User/Date, Sorting: Latest/Username)

September:
  - More User Details (Recorded Name, Picture)
  
  We now have a prototype that already could (should?) be released.
  
  - Networking (WLAN with FTP): Serialisation methods on User/Audio Metadata.
                                Synchronise files to the FTP server, first users, then recordings.
  - Networking, Part 2.
  
  We now have a networked prototype.
