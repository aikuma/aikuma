* http://github.com/shokai/ruby-wav-file

== DESCRIPTION:

Read wav file format and Edit data chunk.


== ENVIRONMENT:

* Ruby 1.8.7
* Ruby 1.9.2
* JRuby 1.6.0


== INSTALL:

* gem install wav-file

== TIPS:

To run samples, you need wav file.
"ffmpeg" is good tool for making wav file from mp3.

    % ffmpeg -i input.mp3 output.wav

Wav-file gem cannot convert format of wav file.
Before edit data-chunk of wav files, you should adjust them using ffmpeg.


== SYNOPSIS:
   

Read format and chunks

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'wav-file'
    
    f = open("input.wav")
    format = WavFile::readFormat(f)
    dataChunk = WavFile::readDataChunk(f)
    f.close
    
    puts format


Extract wav from binary    

    bit = 's*' if format.bitPerSample == 16 # int16_t
    bit = 'c*' if format.bitPerSample == 8 # signed char
    wavs = dataChunk.data.unpack(bit) # read binary


Change volume half

    wavs = wavs.map{|w| w/2}


Reverse wav and encode to binary

    dataChunk.data = wavs.reverse.pack(bit) # reverse
    
    
Save to file

    open("output.wav", "w"){|out|
      WavFile::write(out, format, [dataChunk])
    }

See "samples" directory.
