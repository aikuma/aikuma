Install:
1. Unzip the attached somewhere findable (for example right next to a directory with recordings).
Needs command-line ruby.

Usage:
# Give the Ruby script a path containing these files.
ruby relative/path/to/interleave.rb relative/path/to/directory/recordings/

Example:
ruby interleave.rb ./recordings/

Will output something like:

Processing respeaking #1:
/Users/hanke/temp/aikuma-experiments/interleaver/recordings/43d1e60d-0501-44e7-85a0-452730d339b3.wav
+
/Users/hanke/temp/aikuma-experiments/interleaver/recordings/30e33421-46b8-44b5-8d20-35d1c2e36918.wav
=
/Users/hanke/temp/aikuma-experiments/interleaver/30e33421-46b8-44b5-8d20-35d1c2e36918.interleaved.wav

Processing respeaking #2:
[â€¦ and so on]

The first file is the original, the second the respeaking, the result is after the = and contains interleaved in its filename.

Note that it only works on originals created on Aikuma.
