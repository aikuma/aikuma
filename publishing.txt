In order to publish Aikuma, there are three main steps:

1. Ensure that the versionCode variable in Aikuma/AndroidManifest.xml is > the
version code on Google Play. You can just increment this number
by 1 as the currently displayed version code would have been the last one
uploaded to google play.

2. Included in this directory is sign.sh, which will take care of building,
aligning, and signing the release APK. Run the script and it will eventually
prompt you to enter a passphrase for the keystore. Enter the password. When the
script completes, note the new file bin/Aikuma.apk

3. Uploading the APK to Google Play:
	- Log into https://play.google.com/apps/publish with the Aikuma account
	  (this may require logging out of your own Google account).
	- There are two old instances of Aikuma that are
	  "unpublished", and a third that is published. Click on the published one.
	- Click APK on the list of options on the left hand side.
	- Click "Upload new APK to Production" and follow the steps to their
	  obvious conclusion.
